# SVG

## What are SVG's?
- scalable image format
- easily scale to any size and retain quality without increasing filesize
- you can change properties through CSS and JavaScript

Most often used for:
- Icons
- Graphs
- Large, Simple Images
- Patterned Backgrounds
- Applying effects to other elements via SVG filters

## Vector Graphics vs Raster Graphics

### Vector Graphics
- defined by math
- no pixel grid
- formulas for different shapes and lines... because of these formulas provides scalability with no effect on quality or size of file

### Raster Graphics
- detail limited to size of pixel grid
- the larger the grid the bigger the file size
